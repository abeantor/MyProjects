Assignment 3: Word Frequencies

Prepare a text file that contains text to analyze. It could be song lyrics to your favorite song. 
With your code, youâ€™ll read from the text file and capture the data into a data structure. 
Using a data structure, write the code to count the appearance of each unique word in the lyrics.
Print out a word frequency list. Take a look at the example using Maven to build a Java project 
with open source dependencies.
